## ðŸ“Œ Overview

Potato cultivation is a crucial aspect of agriculture, and diseases can significantly impact crop yield and quality. This project leverages deep learning techniques â€” particularly CNNs â€” to automate the identification and classification of common potato diseases.

By detecting diseases early, this system can help farmers take timely and effective measures, minimizing losses and improving productivity.
